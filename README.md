# Massimo Telegram Notifier

Massimo Telegram Notifier is a Python-based project that allows you to monitor a specific product's availability on Massimo Dutti's website. When the desired product size becomes available, the script sends a notification to a specified Telegram chat.

The script bypasses the website's anti-bot measures and works with GitHub Actions to execute hourly checks.

The web scraping functionality is easily modifiable to adapt to other websites.

## Requirements

- A Telegram bot token and chat ID.

### Obtaining the Telegram Bot Token and Chat ID

1. **Create a Telegram Bot:**
   - Open Telegram and search for the "BotFather" account.
   - Start a conversation with BotFather and use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.
   - Follow the instructions to choose a name and username for your bot.
   - After creation, you will receive a **Bot Token**. Keep it safe.

2. **Add the Bot to Your Group:**
   - Create a new Telegram group or use an existing one.
   - Add your bot to the group.

3. **Promote the Bot to Admin:**
   - To ensure the bot can read all messages, promote it to admin status in the group.

4. **Obtain the Group Chat ID:**
   - Send any message in the group.
   - Use the following URL in your browser to get the updates:

     ```
     https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/getUpdates
     ```

   - Look for the `"chat"` object in the returned JSON. The `"id"` field will be your Group Chat ID.
