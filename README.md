# Massimo Telegram Notifier

**Massimo Telegram Notifier** is a Python-based project that allows you to monitor the availability of specific products on Massimo Dutti's website. When the desired product size becomes available, the script sends a notification to a specified Telegram chat using a bot.

The script works in conjunction with GitHub Actions to perform hourly checks and can be modified to work with other websites by adjusting the web scraping logic.

## Features

- Automated hourly checks for product availability on Massimo Dutti.
- Sends instant notifications to a Telegram chat when the desired size becomes available.
- Easily configurable and adaptable to other websites.

## Requirements

- A Telegram bot token and chat ID.

### Obtaining the Telegram Bot Token and Chat ID

1. **Create a Telegram Bot:**
   - Open Telegram and search for the "BotFather" account.
   - Start a conversation with BotFather and use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.
   - Follow the instructions to choose a name and username for your bot.
   - After creation, you will receive a **Bot Token**. Keep it safe.

2. **Add the Bot to Your Group:**
   - Create a new Telegram group or use an existing one.
   - Add your bot to the group.

3. **Promote the Bot to Admin:**
   - To ensure the bot can read all messages, promote it to admin status in the group.

4. **Obtain the Group Chat ID:**
   - Send any message in the group.
   - Use the following URL in your browser to get the updates, replacing `<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>`:

     ```
     https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates
     ```

   - Look for the `"chat"` object in the returned JSON. The `"id"` field will be your Group Chat ID.
